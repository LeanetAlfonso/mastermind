## About

Mastermind app built in SwiftUI.

Mastermind is code-breaking game whose objective is to guess the secret code in the fewest tries possible.

Each guess is made by selecting color buttons from the color selector until all slots are filled. Once satisfied with your guess, tap the check button and feedback will be provided indicating how many color items have both the right color and position (red), the right color and wrong position (white), or the wrong color (gray).

You can change the settings and challenge yourself by enabling the timer and try to crack the code before time runs out, or you can go easier on yourself by not allowing repeats.

## Running Locally

Clone the repo. Open Mastermind.xcodeproj and run it on a simulator or change the bundle identifier to a unique identifier in order to run it on a physical device. Build using the Mastermind scheme.
